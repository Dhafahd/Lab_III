## Introduction
The purpose of this lab is to get familiar with NLP language models using the Sklearn library. The lab is divided into two parts: the first part focuses on regression models (SVR, Naive Bayes, Linear Regression, Decision Tree Algorithms), and the second part concentrates on classification models (SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Ada Boosting). Through these exercises, you will gain hands-on experience with both types of models, enhancing your understanding of their applications and performance in natural language processing tasks.

## Part 1: Language Modeling / Regression

## Part 2 : Language Modeling / Classification
